        <p>Some people call the national park system the "World's greatest outdoor university." What a great story we have hereâ€”huge geometric earthworks, sophisticated math and geometry, a deep understanding of complex astronomical cycles, artifacts from throughout North America, and all done by a society with a relatively small population that was just beginning to develop agriculture. Almost everyone who studies the Hopewell culture has an "I didn't know that" story about when they first learned about the special and intriguing culture that developed in this region. The park also has an active archeology program which produces even more understanding of this fascinating and yet little recognized culture. This is a story that needs wider recognition. Every American should learn about the amazing accomplishments of the Native American inhabitants of south and central Ohio 2,000 years ago</p>
